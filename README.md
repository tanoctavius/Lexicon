Project Description:
A typing test that calculates wpm and cpm that accounts for word difficulty. All texts are web-scraped and adjusted for consistent difficulty. Code is organised using Object-Orientated Programming within a Model-View-Controller Framework. The program allows a variety of customisable options like difficulty, time, typing modes, aesthetic components and functional aspects. After the test is completed, graphical data and statistics will be shown. There are also different screens: main, lose, leaderboard, information and setting. 

Note:
Overall aesthetic + function of the project was inspired by monkeytype.com

To run the project, download all relevant files (including CMU Graphics - main module framework). Run main.py. 

Extra: To go through the different screens, press the icons located above (typingPage, leaderboardScreen, settingPage and infoPage).
